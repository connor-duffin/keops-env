# Minimal KeOps conda environment

This is a repo containing the minimal requirements needed to setup a `conda` environment with  `KeOps` installed inside of it. These versions of things seem to work for me, installed on a Ubuntu 20.04 system with system install of CUDA 11.2 (i.e. not a `conda` install of CUDA).
